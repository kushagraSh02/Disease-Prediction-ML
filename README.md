Random Forest and MLP Classifier Model to predict a disease based on the symptoms of patients


Created a Random Forest Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron Model to predict the Type of disease in a patient based on the symptoms that the patient shows.

The random forest classifier is a supervised learning algorithm which you can use for regression and classification problems. It consists of multiple decision trees just as a forest has many trees. On top of that, it uses randomness to enhance its accuracy and combat overfitting, which can be a huge issue for such a sophisticated algorithm. These algorithms make decision trees based on a random selection of data samples and get predictions from every tree. After that, they select the best viable solution through votes

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is the most fundamental type of neural network architecture. An MLP is also known as Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) or Deep Feed Forward Network (DFFN) in some literature. Here we use MLP as a classifier to classify the type of disease patient has.

The dataset for the problem contains records with 132 symptoms like itching, skin rash etc and 41 types of diseases from which a patient is diagnosed to. 

Our Random Forest Classifier got the testing accuracy of 100% and MLP classifier got the accuracy of 97.6%.
